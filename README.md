# LEDuino

This is a small wrapper around the Wokwi AVR8js library, for simulating WS2812 LED arrays in the browser. 

It's a fairly simple set of configuration values and constants used to configure an Arduino Mega simulator and execute it, including drawing pixels to a canvas element.

## Usage

You can see an example of this project in the `demo` directory, but basically:

```
import LEDuino from '@elliottkember/leduino';

new LEDuino({
  rows: 14,
  cols: 14,
  serpentine: true,
  hex: {/* A hex object generated by wokwi-hexi */},
  canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
  // onPixels: (pixels) => console.log(pixels.length),
  // onSerial: (text) => console.log(text),
});
```
